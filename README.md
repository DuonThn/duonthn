## Hi, my name is Dekisugi, but you can call me Thien or KoroSensei. 

+ Here's a bit about my profile:

I am a 17-year-old student in Ho Chi Minh City. I have a keen interest in computer hardware and enjoy tinkering with operating systems. 
Whenever I'm bored, I like to read manga or watch anime to pass the time. Sometimes, I also play on my computer! 
My favorite games include Osu!, Honkai Impact 3rd, and various indie games. Honestly, my life is pretty boring, so there's not much else to share. 

And that's it! ^^ Hehe
